## 🚀 Development Journey
**Current Work:** We are in the process of integrating GraphQL with the frontend. Check out the `dev` branch for:
- Completed GraphQL API backend implementation
- Ongoing work to update frontend components to consume GraphQL
- Documentation on the GraphQL endpoint usage

The `main` branch contains the stable REST-only version currently deployed to production.

**Development Milestones:**
**AI-Human Collaboration:** This project was developed through iterative AI assistance combined with human oversight for architecture decisions, code review, and deployment.

**Development Milestones:**
1. Architecture design and technology selection
2. FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
3. Database modeling (User and Post entities)
4. Authentication system implementation
5. Frontend integration with responsive design
6. Render.com deployment configuration

## 📦 API Endpoints
**Authentication:**
- POST /api/auth/register - User registration
- POST /api/auth/login - User login
- GET /api/auth/me - Get current user
- PUT /api/auth/profile - Update user profile
